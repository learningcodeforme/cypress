eq() -Get A DOM element at a specific index in an array of elements

cypess is built on node.js and it used js and it async ( all step not wait for other )

It is very important to understand that Cypress commands don't do anything at the moment they are invoked, but rather enqueue themselves to be run later. This is what we mean when we say Cypress commands are asynchronous


//Cypress queued all of these commands and now
// Cypress will begin running them in order!

cypress of asynchronous in nature  but it take care how to execute in order 

promise() -- it is state 
it have three type 
rejected  -state is rejected
reso state is completed
pending- > state  is yet to complete

to handle promise we have .then()

in cypress promise is hidden from us
