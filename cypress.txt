 prtice website - https://rahulshettyacademy.com/seleniumPractise/

 cypress support mainly css selector 

 auto suggetion in cypress -> /// <reference types= "cypress" />  

 command 
 visit()-> to visit any website
 get() -to  get locator
 type() - > to enter text 
 .should() -assersation 
 cy.wait()- to make wait 
 cy.log()- to print log()

 :visible-- to look for only visible element
 example
  cy.get('.product:visible')

find() - to limited the scope of locator to specfic locator
we have  .products locator in that we found .product

example
  cy.get('.products').find('.product')

eq() -Get A DOM element at a specific index in an array of elements
Example = 
  cy.get('.products').find('.product').eq(2).contains('ADD TO CART')
            .click()


cypess is built on node.js and it used js and it async ( all step not wait for other )

It is very important to understand that Cypress commands don't do anything at the moment they are invoked, but rather enqueue themselves to be run later. This is what we mean when we say Cypress commands are asynchronous


//Cypress queued all of these commands and now
// Cypress will begin running them in order!

cypress of asynchronous in nature  but it take care how to execute in order 

promise() -- it is state 
it have three type 
rejected  -state is rejected
reso state is completed
pending- > state  is yet to complete

to handle promise we have .then()

in cypress promise is hidden from us
if manipulate the cypress then it not handle the promise
example --> it retrun the text ( it hanlde the promise)
cy.get('.brand').text() - text() it is not cypress command and it not work direclty  we need to solve the promise 

text() -it is jquery command 
cypress can allow jquery but it cannot handle promise ( we need to manually solve it)
example 

   const logo = cy.get('.brand').then((logo) => {
            cy.log(logo.text())
   })

 allisa in cypress ising as() 
 alias - as()  we dfine as locator aslia and call the using 
            @alias- name ( check in line number 127)
            cy.get('.products').as('productLocator')
            cy.get('@productLocator').find('.product').eq(0).contains('ADD TO CART').click()

    

Cypress work directly on browser an it not use network proxy or json 
any log we print it print in console of browser

 console.log is not cypess command so it async and it can execute any time .it appear in console of browser ( press F12 and check in console tab of browser)
            console.log('Printing in console')

  to make them in sequence we need to manually solve the promise
 
 
 behavioral assertion

 should('be.checked')-it check it behaviour

_____________________________________________________________________________
 cypress dont have any method to handle mouse over
